**Project Abstract:**

This project aims to maintain patient medical records on a blockchain. 
The DApp architecture offers a patient-centric system where the patient 
has to control over his or her data, i.e., the patient decides who is allowed 
to view their profiles or data. ThreeÂ categories are used by the system to 
group users: Admins, Doctors, and Patients.

Any doctor can request or receive permission from the patient to see their data. 
Patients may also upload files to their profiles or data, such as reports, X-rays, 
or other items, to be preserved via IPFS. The clinicians (who have access) can 
review these files to better evaluate and treat patients. Patients can also view 
the records of previous consultations. Doctors can view the patient records to 
which they have been given access. Doctors can check patient records and previous 
appointments to properly consult or treat their patients.
